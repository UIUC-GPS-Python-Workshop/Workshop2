This is the first file for this lesson!
It's just plain text.
Python can read this file all at once or line-by-line.
You've printed the whole file with print(open_file.read()).
To print one line from the file write print(open_file.read_line()).
What happens if you open this file again and call open_file.readline() three times?
Try it!
